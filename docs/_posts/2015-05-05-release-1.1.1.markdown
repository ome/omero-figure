I am pleased to announce release of OMERO.figure 1.1.1 which
is a point release that contains a small number of bug fixes and
minor feature improvements.

Bug Fixes:

 - Fixes a bug with exporting a figure before saving it
 - Fixes a bug with layout of newly-added big images

Other Changes:

 - Figure legend can now be accessed under menu: 'File' > 'Add Figure Legend'
 - Add a README.txt file to zip files when exporting figure with panels as separate images
 - Crop dialog is initially populated with the current crop region
 - Slight increase in scalebar thickness to improve visibility
