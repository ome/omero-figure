On a recent trip to the University of Sussex to talk about OMERO,
I presented OMERO.figure and it was well recieved. They tried to
install it but they use a different web deployment there,
with everything under an /omero/ prefix. E.g. server/omero/webclient/.

Unfortunately, we had neglegted to test OMERO.figure under these conditions
since our test server in Dundee and my local development server are both
run without any url prefix.

So, the first thing I needed to setup before fixing the bugs was to deploy
my local development OMERO.figure under an /omero/ prefix. It turned out
that the easiest way to do this was to use nginx, which Chris helped me
to setup with the following instructions (which others may find useful).
NB: The proper documentation for this is on the
[OMERO.web deployment docs](https://www.openmicroscopy.org/site/support/omero5/sysadmins/unix/install-web.html)
but this is just what worked for me.
Using homebrew on Mac 10.8:

	$ brew install nginx
	$ dist/bin/omero admin stop
	$ dist/bin/omero web stop
	$ ./build.py clean build
	$ dist/bin/omero admin start
	# you must be using fastcgi-tcp for this example
	$ dist/bin/omero config set omero.web.application_server "fastcgi-tcp"
	$ dist/bin/omero web start
	$ dist/bin/omero web config nginx > omero_nginx.conf


Then apply the omero_nginx.conf.patch below manually. It won't apply directly because
my paths will be different than yours. You may also need to change ports based on
what else you may have running.

Copy the config to a new 'others' directory in your nginx location:

	$ cd /usr/local/etc/nginx
	$ mkdir others
	$ cp path/to/bin/omero/omero_nginx.conf others/

Then edit the nginx config at /usr/local/etc/nginx/nginx.conf to remove the whole
'server' section:

	server { }

And add the following line, right at the bottom of the http section,
to include the omero_nginx.conf:

    include /usr/local/etc/nginx/others/*.conf;


Then you can start nginx, working off of Django workers which use
dist/lib/python/ on http://localhost:8080/omero/

	$ nginx

	# if you need to stop and restart
	$ nginx -s stop && nginx

Following this, I was able to fix all the issues with OMERO.figure under /omero/figure
and all thse fixes will be in the imminent 1.0.0-beta2 release.


UPDATE: When I first wrote this post, all that I needed to do was run nginx from
the bin/omero directory itself, passing it the config file there:

	nginx -c `pwd`/omero_nginx.conf

But now I'm trying it on a new machine some time later, this fails and I need to
move it within the nginx directory as described above.
