We are pleased to announce the release of OMERO.figure 3.1.1.
This is a bug fixing release

Bug fixes include:

 - Fix export of figures created before the introduction of the Reverse Intensity feature in OMERO 5.3.0 ([PR #229](https://github.com/ome/omero-figure/pull/229)).
 - Fix label of channels with LUT assigned. This fixes the failure when exporting the figure ([PR #230](https://github.com/ome/omero-figure/pull/230)).
 - Set the background color of all pages when exporting a figure on multiple pages ([PR #231](https://github.com/ome/omero-figure/pull/231)).
