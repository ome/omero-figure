We are pleased to announce the release of OMERO.figure 1.2.0.
This release introduces support for illustrative ROIs on figure panels.

**NB:** ROIs drawn in OMERO.figure cannot yet be saved as new ROIs on the OMERO server and it is not yet possible to load ROIs from OMERO to use in OMERO.figure.

<h3>Key features</h3>

 - ROIs can be drawn on individual panels
 - Currently supports rectangle, line, arrow and ellipse
 - ROIs can be copied and pasted between panels
 - Rectangles can be pasted as a crop region on another panel

Many of the new ROI features and workflows are described in the [previous blog post]({{ site.baseurl }}/2015/11/09/try-new-roi-features-on-the-demo-app.html) and a full demonstration of these new features can be viewed below:

<h3>Known Issues</h3>

 - The ROI viewer for drawing and editing ROIs does not support rotated image panels. Therefore, rotated panels are displayed without rotation while adding ROIs in the ROI viewer.
 - Rectangle ROIs cannot be rotated. Therefore, crop regions from rotated images will lose their rotation when pasted to create ROI rectangles.
 - ROIs extending outside of panels are not cropped to the panel when exported to PDF.
 - Some of these issues are demonstrated in the video above.
