Development and Contributing to OMERO.figure
============================================


Development
-----------

See the [development](https://github.com/ome/omero-figure/blob/master/README.rst#development)
section of the home page for info on getting set up.

Code notes
----------

The JavaScript code is based on the [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/) framework.
We listen for changes to the Model objects, then `render()` the View objects to update the html
using `underscore.js` templates.

All the front-end code is under `/src/` directory. The `index.html` includes the `js/main.js` as
the JavaScript entry point. This sets up all the Backbone.js objects and listens for changes to the
browser history.

`Backbone.sync()` is automatically called by Backbone when you `save()` a Model object. We override
that to set `"unsaved": true` on the `FigureModel` object which enables the `Save` button in the UI.
For this reason, you should always call `save()` when updating the `Model` objects E.g. `panel.save('x', 100)`
instead of `panel.set('x', 100)`. 

The `Undo/Redo` queue is also setup in `main.js`. The `UndoManager` listens for changes to the `FigureModel`
and to it's collection of `PanelModel` objects. When a change is detected, the `UndoManager` adds an `Undo/Redo`
action to the queue. It is therefore important to NOT update any model object (e.g. `panel.set('x': 0)`)
when rendering the UI as this will add to the Undo/Redo queue.

Testing
-------

When testing a new feature, you should check the following steps:

 - Add several panels to the figure, selecting each in turn and check the feature is working
 - For example, editing a particular property of each panel
 - Select several panels at once, each with different values of this property
 - Check it is the displayed correctly and batch-editing is enabled if appropriate
 - Test that Undo and Redo work as expected.
 - Is the Save button enabled when you make a change?
 - If you refresh the page after Saving, does the change persist?
 - When you export the figure to PDF and TIFF, is this feature handled correctly?
 - Make sure the export script can handle panels where this new property is missing: `panel.get('property', default)`

Contributing
------------

Use: `Fixes #123` to reference an issue in the PR description. This will automatically close the issue when the PR is merged.

Adding a screenshot to the PR description can be helpful, both for initial review but also for
users coming to the PR from the release Changelog.
