There are times when it's useful to switch the
image in a bunch of panels for a new one that's not in the figure.
For example, if you've laid out a few images with a
series of panels, each one with different rendering settings (or
time-points in a movie). Now you want to add a new image
to the figure, but you don't want to go through all those
layout and adjusting steps again. You can simply select
all the panels you want to replace and go to the first
tab on the right. Choose "Set Id" and a dialog will ask you
for the new Image ID....
